  // DEVELOPER NOTES
  // ===============
  
  // setText() Function for changing the text value of the selected item
  // This is reqired because the opacity for the select box
  // is set to "0", so we will not be able to see the value without this.
  
  // usage: setText(element [string], selectedOption [object])
  // example (applied to select box): 
  //  ->  setText('text1', this); - Uses current object as passing reference
  // example (onloaded): 
  //  ->  setText('text1', document.formName.elementName.selectedIndex); - Uses form element object as passing reference
  
  function setText(a, b)
  {
    x = document.getElementById(a);
    if (x)
      x.innerHTML = b.options[b.selectedIndex].innerHTML;
      
  }
